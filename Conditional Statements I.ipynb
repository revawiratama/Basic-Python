    "Conditional statements are statements that control the order of program execution. They are one of the most important concepts that make programming what it is. By specifying conditions, the program is executed with even more dynamism and more automation is possible. Based on what the conditional statements evaluates, the next instruction/set of instructions specified is/are executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## If, elif and else\n",
    "The if, elif and else keywords are used to specify conditional logic. The conditional statements specified by these keywords evaluate to boolean values True or False. They are used for executing decision making processes. \n",

    "From the above, the if statement is used to start a conditional statement declaration. If the statement evaluates to true, the next line of code under this block is executed, if not, the line is skipped to the next. The implementation could be a single if statement, or accompanied by multiple other elif statements.\n",
